# BlueSCSI
:toc: macro

BlueSCSI & ArdSCSino are hardware that reproduces SCSI devices (hard disks) with an Arduino STM32F103C (aka Blue Pill.)

`BlueSCSI` created by https://github.com/erichelgeson[erichelgeson] is a fork of `ArdSCSino-stm32` which adds:

* Mac specific functionality
* Passive SCSI termination
* An alternative power source if not able to be powered by the SCSI bus

`ArdSCSino-stm32` created by https://github.com/ztto/ArdSCSino-stm32[ztto] is the STM32 version of `ArdSCSino`

## Compatibility

If your computer is not listed below - it may be compatible but there is no guarantee it will work. This device is designed and tested to work with pre-PowerPC Macs.

### Compatible

## Usage

Hard Disk image files are placed in the root directory of a `FAT32` (or `ExFat`) formatted SD card. You can create a disk image using `dd` or any raw disk will work. See premade disks below. These images are compatible with the RaSCSI device and Basilisk II emulator.

The naming convention is as follows (file name max 32 characters). Note you may mount multiple drives at a time to different SCSI ID's.

`HDxy_512.hda`
```
HD - Hard Disk
x - SCSI ID to attach to. 0-7 (though 7 on a Macintosh is the System)
y - LUN id usually 0. 
512 - Sector size. Usually 512. 256, 512, & 1024 supported.
```

### Examples:

`HD10_512.hda` - Hard Disk at SCSI ID 1, LUN 0, sector size of 512. 
`HD51_512 System 6.0.8L LC.hda` - Hard Disk at SCSI ID 5, LUN 1, sector size of 512. Text between block size and .hda is ignored.

### Bad 

`HD99_712 foo bar fizz buzz bang.hda` Over 32 chars and invalid SCSI/LUN/Block size....

If no image files are found PC13 will pulse on and off. Check the log file for any errors.

### Blanks & Premade Images

Any blank raw file will do. They are easy to come by as they are used in other devices and emulators such as https://www.emaculation.com/doku.php/basiliskii_osx_setup[Basilisk II].

* Blanks of various sizes from gryphel.com - https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/extras/blanks/
* Premade from savagetaylor.com - https://www.savagetaylor.com/downloads/downloads-macintosh/ 
* Premade from RaSCSI - http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/rascsi-68kmla-edition

### Custom Disk Images

This technique is useful when you would like a disk image larger than the pre-built images in the previous section.

The following instructions demonstrates the process using https://ss64.com/osx/dd.html[dd] on a modern Mac:

1. Open terminal.
2. The following command will create a blank disk image. You can modify the command to suit your use.
   * `dd if=/dev/zero of=example.hda bs=1m count=500`
   * The `count` field defines the number of megabytes (`bs=1m`) the total disk image should be.
   * The output file from the command is "example.hda". This can be changed in the `of=example.hda` field.
3. Place the new blank disk image in the root directory of your SD card.
4. If you do not already have a tool to format SCSI drives, https://macintoshgarden.org/apps/lido-756[download LIDO]. You can use an emulator such as https://www.emaculation.com/doku.php/basiliskii_osx_setup[Basilisk II] to move files to the image to prepare your installation.
5. After booting into your target machine with the working Mac OS disk image on your BlueSCSI from step 3, format the blank disk.

### Termination

To enable termination place the two jumpers on the TERM block. Termination should be enabled if it is the last device in the chain - which is normally how it is used.

## Troubleshooting

### Log Files

If your device is not working - check the `LOG.txt` in the root of the SD card.

### Verify you are not using a fake

https://github.com/keirf/Greaseweazle/wiki/STM32-Fakes[How to tell if your STM32 is fake]

### Performance is slower than expected

Try a different SD card. Cheap/old SD cards can affect performance.

## Development

Below is for users who wish to edit or develop on the BluePill - normal users should not need to worry about this.

### Setup PlatformIO

Open the project in https://platformio.org/[PlatformIO] and everything is pre-configured.

## Flashing

When flashing you have two options:

Flash by setting up the IDE and re-compiling and programming. If you are a developer and plan to contribute this method is what you should use.

You may also flash the `.bin` file directly from STM32CubeProgrammer. If you are not a developer and just wish to get the code to the BluePill, use this (as development environment setup can be a bit tricky!)

### Using STLink v2 (prefered)

1. Remove SD Card
2. Make sure the STLink is up to date - https://my.st.com/content/my_st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/stm32-software-development-tools/stm32-programmers/stsw-link007.license=1610785194992.product=STSW-LINK007.version=2.37.26.html[Latest Firmware]
3. Connect pins `SWDIO`(2), `GND`(4), `SWCLK`(6), and `3.3v`(8) from the programmer to the Blue Pill. NOTE: These are not the same as Serial ports.
4. Run the PlatformIO: Upload task.
5. You should see the LED `PC_13` flashing indicating no SD Card detected.
6. Insert SD Card, boot on your favorite Mac!

#### Trouble Shooting

If the device is not detected you may need to hold reset, click program, once it is detected release reset.

If you are unable to get the device in DFU mode for programming you may need to use https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html[STM32CubeProgrammer] to erase the chip.

### Alterantive upload methods

See the https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/boards/ststm32/bluepill_f103c8.html#uploading[uploading] documentation on PlatformIO for alterantives.

### Using USB HID

Note: I have not been able to get this method to work.
